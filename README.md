# Parsite

Parsite is a micro tiny parser combinator library for parsing strings that I originally made for a language project (coming soon hopefully).

Right now this is just for fun, however I do plan to develop this project more.

If you plan to use this, I will upload this to opam after a few checks.

I'd also like to thank [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDalzi7mhdY) for the help and inspiration.
