# Parsite

Parsite is a micro tiny parser combinator library for parsing strings that I originally made for a language project (coming soon hopefully).

Right now this is just for fun, however I do plan to develop this project more.

**Now in opam shape!** Instructions for installation along with docs and examples can be found at https://faber-1.github.io/parsite/

I'd also like to thank [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDalzi7mhdY) for the help and inspiration.
